# Speech to Text
A little example about how to use the Speech to Text in Flutter.

This is just a base example. You can use this as a starting point for your own projects.
You need to think about the following things:
- Validation: All word or sounds are valid. For example: "e" can sound like "eh", "he" or "e".
- I recomennd to use a dictionary to validate the words.
- Save the words to a database to improve the app and learn new words may match.
- Modularize the code. This is a good practice that I ignore for now. May be later.
- Use the microphone to record the audio. This means you need to active the microphone permission.
